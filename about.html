  <h1> Who is Htoo Eain Thin? </h1>
  <p>About: Htoo Eain Thin</p>
<p>Every step I take,<br />Every move I make,<br />Every single day,<br />Every time I pray,<br />Ill be missing you . . .</p>
<p>STANDING in a crowd of more than 2000 people, we murmured this song at the funeral of singer and songwriter Htoo Ein Thyn on August 16.</p>
<p>Friends, family and fans gathered to pay their last respects to one of Myanmars most respected artists who died aged 42.</p>
<p>The Yayway cemetery was awash with monsoon rain and the mood among mourners was sombre. Yangons young and old turned out to mourn the loss of the skinny, curly-haired and bespectacled artist who, like his lyrics, Oh evening star! You are smashed while shining brightly, left the world while still in his prime.</p>
<p>His death has made us sad and we feel as though we have lost something very valuable. There was so much more we could have learned from him, a young male fan said.</p>
<p>Htoo Ein Thyn died of a heart disease which had been attributed to his excessive drinking.</p>
<p>Maung Maung Zaw Latt, lead guitarist of the Ants, lived close to Htoo Ein Thyn and said that on August 13, Htoo Ein Thyn was taken to a private clinic as he seemed run-down.</p>
<p>At 11:40am the next day, he died.</p>
<p>Maung Maung Zaw Latt said Htoo Ein Thyn had heart and lung problems.</p>
<p>He had had heart disease for a long time but he didnt tell anyone about it. He didnt take care of his health and that is why we lost him, Maung Maung Zaw Latt said.</p>
<p>Htoo Ein Thyn, who was nicknamed Hynet Kyee or Ko Hynet (bird) by his friends, is considered to have been a major contributor to the advancement of Myanmars music industry.</p>
<p>Bird reportedly knew from a young age he wanted to be a musician and left his home in Pathein and moved to Mawlamyaing in Mon State to pursue his dreams.</p>
<p>His debut album Nar Yi Paw Ka Myat Ye Set Myar (Teardrops on clock), which was released in 1986, was well received by fans and other musicians. His songs were different from mainstream music and of the 500 songs he produced about 80 per cent were composed and written by him.</p>
<p>Songs including Yar Za Win Myar Ye Tha Dot Tha Mee (Bride of histories), Amae Ein (Mothers home), Maha Wira O Buddha (Great Lord Buddha) were among his most popular.</p>
<p>He worked in the music industry for about 18 years and in that time produced 14 albums, including a live and unplugged CD that was recorded at Aung San Stadium.</p>
<p>His copy albums (comprised of cover songs) were also popular with his fans.</p>
<p>Songwriter Myint Moe Aung, who wrote the lyrics for one such album, said, He gave me my start in the industry. He is one of the reasons that I became a songwriter.</p>
<p>Myint Moe Aung said Htoo Ein Thyn started writing and studying music while attending Pathein College in 1981.</p>
<p>He wrote songs even back then, some of which are now famous, for example, Way Thwar De Akhar (Were we are apart). He spent as much time studying music as he did his school lessons, Myint Moe Aung said.</p>
<p>But that did not mean Htoo Ein Thyn did not enjoy studying and he reportedly spent a lot of time with his nose in a book. Myint Moe Aung said one of his earliest memories of Htoo Ein Thyn was of him reading a book through his thick glasses, in the corner of the school corridor.</p>
<p>From the first time I met him, until his last day with us, I would always see him reading. He loved books and had a broad knowledge of Buddhist teachings, art music and health, Myint Moe Aung said.</p>
<p>Htoo Ein Thyn often underlined passages in the books he was reading and in the last book he read before he died, Opposite Articles by Maung Thamanya, he had underlined the sentences, Although one was not educated to adore and appreciate arts, he should have been educated to esteem it, and An artist is always an awkward person.</p>
<p>Songwriter Shwe Gyaw Gyaw, who had been a friend of Htoo Ein Thyn since 1989, said the singer was an intelligent man who often led discussions on religion and history. Shwe Gyaw Gyaw said it seemed unbelievable that Htoo Ein Thyn was dead.</p>
<p>Music producer Ko Zaw Thit said he felt extreme sadness over the death of Htoo Ein Thyn and said, It was too early for him.</p>
<p>When the Myanmar Times asked Shwe Gyaw Gyaw to write down a few words about his friend he paused for some time before writing, He loved freedom.</p>
<p>He had strong ideas and clear concepts. His creations were full of love and wisdom.</p>
<p>He hated money, fame, fake people and imitation art. His death is a great loss. I have wept for him.</p>
<p>Maung Maung Zaw Latt said it was a great pity Htoo Ein Thyn died at such a young age.</p>
<p>He taught us music theory and gave us musical knowledge but we had so much more to learn and now he is gone, he said.</p>
<p>Musicians like him only come around once in a hundred years. Losing him means losing a friend, a mentor and a leader, he said.</p>
<p>Myint Moe Aung said because there was no room in Htoo Ein Thyns head for anything but his music, his health and his appearance often suffered.</p>
<p>Anage from Iron Cross said he felt lost since Htoo Ein Thyns passing and Zaw Win Htut of Emperor said Htoo Ein Thyn was, irreplaceable. He was a genius.</p>
<p>Bird was not often seen on stage but occasionally he teamed up with other bands for a performance. His last concert was at Sedona hotel on August 7, where he performed one song, Zat Paung Khan (Happy ending).</p>
<p>Famous lyricist Win Min Htways words expressed all music lovers prayer, May the bird fly to a peaceful place.</p>
